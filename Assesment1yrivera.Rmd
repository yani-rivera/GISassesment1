## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
######## First we load some libraries
options(java.home="C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_191\\")
library("sf")
library("tmap")
## We already installed the library so we only need to load them.
##Now we read the shapefile with the data
WBCOPER2 <- st_read("AssesLatv8.shp")
### we validate that the file is ok
class(WBCOPER2)
WBCOPER2
### The information seems to be ok, now we plot the first map
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(WBCOPER2) + tm_polygons("YEAR2015")
### Now are some additional data to compare diferent years.
tm_shape(WBCOPER2) + tm_fill(col=c("YEAR2010","YEAR2010","YEAR2015"),title=c('% Higher Education Emigrate Intention 2005','2010','2015')) + 
  tm_borders()
### Maps are presenting the right information. But some adjustments are needed, Label are overlaping the map and we need some Title
tm_shape(WBCOPER2) + tm_fill(col=c("YEAR2005","YEAR2010","YEAR2015")) +
  tm_borders() + tm_layout(panel.labels=c("2005","2010","2015")) +
  tm_legend(legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),main.title = "%Latinos with Higher Education & Emigrate Intention", main.title.position = "right")

### This is the first basic map
